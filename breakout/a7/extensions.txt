I changed the elliptical ball into a GImage ball by initializing a GImage instead of a GEllipse in the ball initializer.
The image used was beach-ball.png

There is sound whenever the ball collides with the bricks and sound whenever the ball collides with the paddle.
I created two attributes: _break_sound and _bounce_sound in the play class, which are assigned to the Sound objects
'plate1.wav' and 'bounce.wav' respectively.

Every time a brick is destroyed, the number of bricks you have broken is displayed in place of the broken brick.
For example, if you have already broken 5 bricks and the ball has collided with the sixth brick, the message will
display '6.' I created an attribute: _collision_label, which is assigned to the message of the number of bricks broken
